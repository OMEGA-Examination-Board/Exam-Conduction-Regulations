# Introduction

The OMEGA Examination Board Exam Conduction Regulations, or for short, OEB ECR, is a set of regulations and procedures that all registered centres hosting OEB qualifications must follow to ensure that malpractice and maladministration is kept to the minimum. All registered centres are expected to follow the ECR to the best of their ability, and the regulations stipulated within the ECR will be enforced by "OEB Inspectors."

**What is an OEB Inspector?:** These are individuals from the OEB's official "Centre Inspection Service (CIS)" and are responsible for ensuring that registered centres follow the ECR to the best of their ability. They have the authority to administer consequences to failing centres, and can or may write up reports signifiying the necessary steps, and they can provide guidance to help centres for future exams.
